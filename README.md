  Fractionalized Real-World Assets Database Schema
</h1>
# Provision-IT – Backend Service (Personal Showcase)

This repository is my personal showcase version of a University of Melbourne
client-based Agile team project (COMP30022).

The original team final delivery repository can be found here:
https://github.com/Evelyn-0yi/Provision-it

## Project Overview

Provision-IT is a fractional asset ownership platform that allows users to
browse assets, purchase fractions, manage portfolios, and track asset value
history.

The backend service is built with Flask and PostgreSQL, exposing RESTful APIs
to support authentication, asset management, trading, and portfolio operations.

## My Role & Contribution

I worked as a backend-focused developer in this client-based Agile project, with responsibilities spanning
database design, API development, and frontend-backend integration.

### Backend & Database Design
- Contributed to early system design decisions around fractional asset modelling, proposing a fixed-unit
  fraction approach (instead of percentage-based ownership) to simplify valuation, aggregation, and
  transaction consistency.
- Designed and implemented the AssetValueHistory table to support historical valuation tracking and
  manual price adjustments by administrators, including audit fields such as timestamp, source,
  adjusted_by, and adjustment_reason.

### API Development & Business Logic
- Implemented RESTful APIs using Flask and SQLAlchemy to support asset valuation history queries and
  administrator price updates.
- Built read-only portfolio APIs for user holdings and transaction history:
  - `GET /users/<user_id>/fractions/owning` to aggregate user holdings by asset, including latest value and
    estimated portfolio value.
  - `GET /users/<user_id>/transactions` with asset filtering and pagination, returning transactions in
    reverse chronological order.
- Implemented backend service logic for valuation calculations, transaction aggregation, and structured
  JSON responses for frontend consumption.

### Frontend Integration & Testing
- Integrated backend APIs with frontend HTML/JavaScript pages to display asset valuation history,
  user holdings, and transaction records.
- Wrote and executed integration tests using pytest to validate API correctness and data consistency.
- Assisted with local environment setup, database initialization, and data import workflows
  (init_db_postgres.py, environment configuration, and troubleshooting).

### Collaboration & Engineering Practices
- Actively participated in Agile workflows including sprint planning, stand-ups, pull requests, and
  code reviews.
- Submitted pull requests with detailed descriptions and responded quickly to feedback, fixing issues
  during integration testing on the same day.
- Contributed to project documentation by adding setup notes, common errors, and troubleshooting
  guidance to improve developer onboarding.

- Tools: Git, GitHub, Agile workflow

The rest of this repository contains the full team delivery for technical context.

This project implements a proof-of-concept schema and system for **fractionalised ownership of real-world assets**.
It supports asset creation, fraction trading, valuation tracking, and historical ledger views.

## Problem Statement

We think creating a database schema for fractionalised ownership of real world assets will solve the problem of tracking, trading, and reporting asset fractions at scale.

**We'll know we've succeeded if:**
- Users can create assets, divide them into fractions, and trade them reliably
- The system maintains a clear ledger of ownership history and asset values (whole and fractional) at any point in time
- Queries remain performant even as the number of assets and trades grows large

## Project Scope

### Must Have
- Database schema for assets, fractions, holdings, users, and transactions
- Ability to trade fractions between owners with real-time updates
- Ownership ledger to view history and snapshots
- Asset valuation reporting (whole + fractional)
- Platform manager role for approving assets and setting fraction counts

### Nice to Have
- Support for multiple asset categories (property, collectibles, etc.)
- Query optimization and performance reports
- Performance/stress testing framework
- Basic UI with light/dark mode
- API layer with OpenAPI routes
- User authentication & activity tracking

### Not in Scope
- Real-time price feeds and external market integration
- Guest user roles
- Advanced trading features (bidding/auctions)
- Blockchain/tokenisation implementation

## Dependencies
Before cloning and attempting to run this code, you will need:
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Git (Optional, repo can also be downloaded as .zip)
- Virtual Environment (venv)

<br/>

## Getting Started

This project provides a complete database schema and API implementation for fractionalized real-world asset management, developed for Provision-it.

1. Clone this repo to your device.
2. Run the automated setup script:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `./setup_env.sh`
   - **Windows**: `setup_env.bat`
3. Create a PostgreSQL database and configure your `.env` file with database settings
4. Initialize the database schema and data: `python init_db_postgres.py`
5. Start the application: `python run.py` or `flask run`
6. Access the application at `http://localhost:5001`

<br/>

## Deployment

You can deploy this application to any hosting platform of your choice. For production deployment:

1. Configure production environment variables in `.env`
2. Set up PostgreSQL database on your hosting platform
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Initialize database: `python init_db_postgres.py`
5. Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn: `gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5001 run:app`

For detailed deployment instructions, see [SetUp.md](Document/SetUp.md).
Then follow [User_Manual.pdf](Document/User_Manual.pdf) for instructions on using the web app.

## Database Schema

The core of this project is a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema designed specifically for fractionalized real-world asset management. The schema includes the following main entities:

- **Users**: User accounts and profiles for asset owners and traders
- **Assets**: Real-world assets available for fractionalization (properties, collectibles, etc.)
- **Fractions**: Fractional ownership units representing portions of assets
- **Transactions**: Complete buy/sell transaction records with ownership transfers
- **Offers**: Trading offers and bids for asset fractions
- **AssetValueHistory**: Historical asset value tracking for both whole and fractional valuations
- **Portfolios**: User portfolio tracking and management

This schema enables reliable tracking of ownership history, real-time trading capabilities, and comprehensive reporting at scale.

For detailed schema information, see `schema_postgres.sql` and [ER_diagram.png](Document/ER_diagram.png).
